# VEX Robotics Competition Control System

## Introduction
This repository contains the complete control system code for a VEX Robotics competition robot. The system is designed to work with VEX V5 components and includes modules for motor control, sensor integration, autonomous routines, and user control interfaces.

## Features
- **PID Control**: Implementation of Proportional, Integral, Derivative (PID) controllers for precise movement control.
- **Drive System**: Versatile driving commands for different modes including tank, arcade, and holonomic controls.
- **Odometry System**: Accurate tracking of the robot's position and orientation using sensory input.
- **Autonomous Routines**: Pre-programmed routines for autonomous operations during competitions.
- **User Control**: Manual control mappings for real-time operation during driver control periods.

## Hardware Requirements
- VEX V5 motors
- VEX Inertial Sensor
- VEX Brain
- VEX Controller

## Software Requirements
- VEXcode Pro V5 or similar VEX programming environment

# Resilience Unbound

In the eleventh hour, against all odds we found,  
Triumph whispered in moments profound.  
Through trials and doubts, our resolve unwound,  
Victory embraced on uncertain ground.

In the final stretch, courage unbound,  
A testament to resilience, unconfined.  
Not in the start, but in the grind,  
We rose, defying the constraints that bind.
