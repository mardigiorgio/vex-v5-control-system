# VEX Robotics Competition Control System

## Introduction
This repository contains the complete control system code for a VEX Robotics competition robot. The system is designed to work with VEX EDR components and includes modules for motor control, sensor integration, autonomous routines, and user control interfaces.

## Features
- **PID Control**: Implementation of Proportional, Integral, Derivative (PID) controllers for precise movement control.
- **Drive System**: Versatile driving commands for different modes including tank, arcade, and holonomic controls.
- **Odometry System**: Accurate tracking of the robot's position and orientation using sensory input.
- **Autonomous Routines**: Pre-programmed routines for autonomous operations during competitions.
- **User Control**: Manual control mappings for real-time operation during driver control periods.

## Hardware Requirements
- VEX EDR motors (specific ports and configurations detailed in the code)
- VEX Inertial Sensor
- VEX Brain
- VEX Controller

## Software Requirements
- VEXcode Pro V5 or similar VEX programming environment
